# AirGead-Banking

The Airgead Banking Investment Calculator project aimed to create an educational tool for high school students to understand the concepts of fiscal responsibility and the power of compound interest. By allowing users to visualize how their investments grow over time, the application solves the problem of providing an interactive and comprehensible way to see the impact of their financial decisions. I successfully implemented the core functionality, ensuring accurate calculations and an intuitive user interface. The most challenging part was implementing the compound interest calculations with monthly deposits, which required breaking down the problem into smaller steps and rigorously testing the logic. Utilizing online tutorials, documentation, peer reviews, and debugging tools helped me overcome these challenges and ensure the implementation was sound.

This project has honed several transferable skills, including problem-solving, object-oriented programming, attention to detail, and user-centered design. These skills are valuable for future projects and coursework. To make the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed best practices such as clear naming conventions, inline comments, modular design, and consistent formatting. Additionally, enhancing input validation, implementing a graphical user interface, and optimizing performance are areas where the code could be improved for better security, efficiency, and user engagement. Reflecting on this project has solidified my learning experience and prepared me to tackle future challenges with greater confidence and skill.
